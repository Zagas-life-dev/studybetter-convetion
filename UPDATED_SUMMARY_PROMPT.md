📚 Expert-Level PDF-to-Study Guide Transformer Prompt (Updated for Adaptive Learning System with Media Support)

📋 TASK OVERVIEW

Convert any educational PDF into a comprehensive, exam-ready study guide using logical structure, visual formatting, and practical insights. The guide must be self-contained and optimized for deep learning, active recall, and quick revision. 

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE**: You MUST cover EVERY aspect of the PDF without skipping any detail. This includes:
- Every section, subsection, and sub-subsection
- All key terms, definitions, and concepts
- Every example, case study, and illustration
- All formulas, equations, and mathematical expressions
- Every process, procedure, and step-by-step instruction
- All tables, charts, and data points (summarize them fully)
- Every diagram description and visual element explanation
- All footnotes, side notes, and supplementary information
- Every comparison, contrast, and relationship
- All historical context, background information, and applications
- Every important detail, nuance, and subtle point
- All references, citations, and related topics mentioned

**DO NOT SKIP**: Even if content seems minor, repetitive, or supplementary, it must be included in your summary. Every paragraph, bullet point, and piece of information in the PDF should be represented. If the PDF has 20 sections, your summary must cover all 20. If it has 50 examples, include all 50. If it has 100 key terms, summarize all 100. The summary should be comprehensive enough that a reader can use it as a complete study resource.

**IMPORTANT**: This content will be displayed in an adaptive reading interface that automatically adjusts formatting, spacing, colors, and typography based on the user's neurodivergence profile (ADHD, Dyslexia, Autism, or AUDHD). Structure your content to work optimally with these adaptive display features.

🔍 ANALYSIS PHASES

1. **Initial Scan**: Detect document layout, headings, and academic level
   - **Count and catalog**: Identify and list every section, subsection, heading, and subheading
   - **Inventory all content**: Document every example, table, diagram, formula, definition, and piece of information
   - **Map the document**: Create a complete inventory of ALL content to ensure comprehensive coverage

2. **Concept Extraction**: Identify terms, theories, comparisons, and examples
   - **Extract EVERY term**: Every technical term, concept name, theory, model, and definition must be captured
   - **Capture ALL examples**: Every example, case study, illustration, and practical application
   - **Document ALL comparisons**: Every comparison, contrast, distinction, and relationship

3. **Pattern Mapping**: Highlight relationships, processes, frameworks
   - **Map ALL connections**: Every relationship, dependency, hierarchy, and connection between concepts
   - **Track ALL processes**: Every procedure, workflow, step-by-step instruction, and sequential process
   - **Document ALL frameworks**: Every theoretical framework, model, structure, and classification system

4. **Contextual Enrichment**: Add historical background, applications, and scholar views
   - **Include ALL context**: Every historical note, background information, and real-world application
   - **Preserve ALL supplementary info**: Every footnote, side note, tip, warning, and additional detail
   - **Capture ALL references**: Every citation, cross-reference, and mention of related topics

📝 FORMATTING GUIDELINES

**Markdown Structure** (Use clear, progressive headings):

- `#` for the main title

- `##` for top-level sections

- `###` for subsections

- `####` for nested examples or theories

**Text Formatting**:

- **Bold** all key definitions, distinctions, and theorist names

- Use bullet points (`-` or `*`) for concept lists

- Use numbered lists (`1.`, `2.`, etc.) for sequential steps or classifications

- Use *italics* sparingly for side notes, examples, or cultural context (note: italics are automatically converted to bold for dyslexic users)

- Use `---` (horizontal rules) to divide major sections

- Leave adequate spacing between sections for easy reading and scanning

**Mathematical Content**:

- Use **inline math**: `$E = mc^2$` for short equations within a sentence

- Use **block math** for standalone equations or derivations:

  ```

  $$

  E = mc^2

  $$

  ```

- Ensure block math is centered and on its own line

- Always format mathematical expressions using LaTeX notation

- If no formulas are found in the source material, do not include any

**Media Enhancement (Images ONLY for Summaries)**:

- **CRITICAL RULE**: NEVER use images from the PDF. ONLY request external images from free sources (Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, Unsplash).

- **ABSOLUTELY NO VIDEOS IN SUMMARIES**: This is a SUMMARY task. You MUST ONLY use images. NEVER use `[VIDEO: ...]` or `[YT: ...]` format. Videos are ONLY for explanations, NOT summaries.

- **CRITICAL**: Always include Subject + Topic + Specific Details in your search queries

  - Subject: The academic subject (e.g., Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics) - discover this from the PDF content

  - Topic: The main topic from the PDF/note (e.g., Set Theory, Photosynthesis, Organic Reactions)

  - Specific Details: The exact concept (e.g., intersection, union, light-dependent reactions, substitution reaction)

  

- **For SUMMARIES**: You MUST request images using `[IMAGE: Subject Topic SpecificDetails]` format

  - ✅ CORRECT: `[IMAGE: Mathematics Set Theory Venn diagram intersection]` or `[IMAGE: Mathematics Set Theory Venn diagram union]`

  - ✅ CORRECT: `[IMAGE: Biology Photosynthesis light-dependent reactions diagram]`

  - ✅ CORRECT: `[IMAGE: Chemistry Organic Reactions substitution reaction mechanism]`

  - ✅ CORRECT: `[IMAGE: Physics Mechanics Newton's laws force diagram]`

  - ❌ WRONG: `[IMAGE: venn diagram]` (too vague, will get wrong images)

  - ❌ WRONG: `[IMAGE: diagram]` (not specific enough)

  - ❌ WRONG: `[IMAGE: photosynthesis]` (missing specific details - which part of photosynthesis?)

  - ❌ WRONG: Using the same query for different concepts (e.g., using "venn diagram" for both intersection AND union)

  - ❌ WRONG: `[VIDEO: ...]` or `[YT: ...]` - ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN in summaries

  

- **STRATEGIC IMAGE USAGE**: 

  - **Use images when they add value** - Only include images that directly support understanding of the content. Images should clarify, illustrate, or enhance concepts that benefit from visual representation

  - **When to use images**:
    - Complex processes or workflows that are easier to understand visually
    - Diagrams, charts, or structures that are central to the topic
    - Mathematical concepts that benefit from visual representation (graphs, geometric shapes)
    - Scientific structures (molecular structures, anatomical diagrams, etc.)
    - Concepts that are inherently visual (maps, timelines, classification trees)

  - **When NOT to use images**:
    - Simple text-based concepts that don't need visual aid
    - Abstract ideas that can't be meaningfully visualized
    - Redundant images that don't add new information
    - Images that don't directly relate to the content being discussed

  - **Place images strategically** - Add images where they enhance understanding, not just for decoration:
    - After introducing a complex concept that benefits from visualization
    - When explaining processes that are clearer with diagrams
    - For formulas or equations that have meaningful visual representations
    - For structures or classifications that are better understood visually

  - **Quality over quantity** - Use 2-4 well-chosen, relevant images per major section rather than adding images unnecessarily. Each image should serve a clear educational purpose

  

- **CRITICAL RULES**:

  - ✅ ALWAYS include: Subject (discovered from PDF) + Topic from PDF + Specific Details in every query

  - ✅ Use DIFFERENT queries for DIFFERENT concepts (e.g., "intersection" vs "union" need different images)

  - ✅ DO use: `[IMAGE: Subject Topic SpecificDetails]` format when images genuinely enhance understanding

  - ✅ DO use: Images strategically for concepts that benefit from visual representation (processes, structures, diagrams, graphs)

  - ❌ NEVER use: `[VIDEO: ...]` or `[YT: ...]` format - ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN in summaries

  - ❌ NEVER use: Base64 encoded images (`data:image/png;base64,...`) - these are not useful

  - ❌ NEVER use: Direct image URLs (`https://example.com/image.png`)

  - ❌ NEVER use: Generic queries like `[IMAGE: venn diagram]` - always include subject, topic, and specific details

  - ❌ NEVER use: Images from the PDF itself - ONLY request external images from free sources

  - ❌ NEVER use: PDF images, PDF diagrams, or any visual content from the uploaded PDF

  - ❌ NEVER use: The same query for different concepts - each concept needs its own specific query

  

- **PDF Links**: You can include PDF links as hyperlinks in your content. PDF links will be rendered as clickable links that open in a new tab. You can also embed PDFs using iframe format: `<iframe src="https://example.com/document.pdf"></iframe>`. The system will automatically render PDFs in an embedded viewer with an option to open in a new tab.

- **IMPORTANT**: All images must come from external sources only. The system automatically replaces these markers with actual images from Wikipedia/Wikimedia Commons/Unsplash. Do NOT extract or reference images from the PDF.

- Use specific, descriptive search queries that include subject (from PDF), topic (from PDF), and exact concept details

- Different concepts MUST use different queries to get the correct images

- Place image markers where they will genuinely enhance understanding - only when the visual adds educational value

- Use images strategically (2-4 per major section) for concepts that benefit from visual representation - avoid unnecessary or redundant images

**Visual Structure** (Optimized for Adaptive Display):

- Create clear visual hierarchy with consistent heading levels

- Use spacing strategically to create visual breaks (especially important for ADHD users)

- Structure content in digestible chunks (2-3 sentence paragraphs work best)

- Use lists liberally to break up dense text

- Include clear transitions between topics
