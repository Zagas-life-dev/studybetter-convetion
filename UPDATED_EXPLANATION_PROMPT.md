📚 Expert-Level PDF-to-Explanatory Guide Transformer Prompt (Updated for Adaptive Learning System with Media Support)

📋 TASK OVERVIEW

Transform any educational PDF into a deeply explanatory, structured learning resource. The goal is to help readers fully understand and internalize the material, not just memorize it. Output must be self-contained, visually clear, and layered for conceptual depth.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE**: You MUST cover EVERY aspect of the PDF without skipping any detail. This includes:
- Every section, subsection, and sub-subsection
- All key terms, definitions, and concepts
- Every example, case study, and illustration
- All formulas, equations, and mathematical expressions
- Every process, procedure, and step-by-step instruction
- All tables, charts, and data points (describe them fully in text)
- Every diagram description and visual element explanation
- All footnotes, side notes, and supplementary information
- Every comparison, contrast, and relationship
- All historical context, background information, and applications
- Every important detail, nuance, and subtle point
- All references, citations, and related topics mentioned

**DO NOT SKIP**: Even if content seems minor, repetitive, or supplementary, it must be included. Every paragraph, bullet point, and piece of information in the PDF should be addressed in your explanation. If the PDF has 20 sections, your explanation must cover all 20. If it has 50 examples, address all 50. If it has 100 key terms, explain all 100.

**IMPORTANT**: This content will be displayed in an adaptive reading interface that automatically adjusts formatting, spacing, colors, and typography based on the user's neurodivergence profile (ADHD, Dyslexia, Autism, or AUDHD). Structure your content to work optimally with these adaptive display features.

🔍 ANALYSIS PHASES

1. **Initial Scan** – Understand the document structure, topic flow, and educational depth
   - **Count and catalog**: Identify every section, subsection, heading, and subheading
   - **Inventory all content**: List every example, table, diagram, formula, definition, and piece of information
   - **Map the document**: Create a mental map of ALL content to ensure nothing is missed

2. **Concept Isolation** – Identify all key terms, nuanced distinctions, and difficult areas
   - **Extract EVERY term**: Every technical term, concept name, theory, model, and definition
   - **Capture ALL nuances**: Every distinction, variation, exception, and special case
   - **Note ALL difficult areas**: Every complex concept, abstract idea, and challenging topic

3. **Relationship Mapping** – Analyze how ideas relate, depend on, or build upon each other
   - **Map ALL connections**: Every relationship, dependency, hierarchy, and connection between concepts
   - **Track ALL references**: Every cross-reference, citation, and mention of related topics
   - **Document ALL dependencies**: Every prerequisite, building block, and foundational concept

4. **Contextual Anchoring** – Extract and add real-world links, historical cues, or theories
   - **Include ALL context**: Every historical note, background information, and real-world application
   - **Capture ALL examples**: Every example, case study, illustration, and practical application
   - **Preserve ALL supplementary info**: Every footnote, side note, tip, warning, and additional detail

📝 FORMATTING GUIDELINES

**Markdown Structure** (Use clear, progressive headings):

- `#` for the main title

- `##` for sections

- `###` for subsections

- `####` for example explanations or deep dives

**Text Formatting**:

- **Bold** all key concepts, terms, and ideas

- Use bullet points (`-` or `*`) for grouped information

- Use numbered lists (`1.`, `2.`, etc.) for sequential logic or procedures

- Use *italics* for contextual examples or alternate interpretations (note: italics are automatically converted to bold for dyslexic users)

- Include horizontal lines (`---`) to break major sections

- Leave adequate spacing between sections for easy reading and scanning

**Mathematical Content**:

- Use **inline math**: `$E = mc^2$` for short equations within a sentence

- Use **block math** for standalone equations or derivations:

  ```

  $$

  E = mc^2

  $$

  ```

- Ensure block math is centered and on its own line

- Always format mathematical expressions using LaTeX notation

- If no formulas are found in the source material, do not include any

**Media Enhancement (Images and Videos for Explanations)**:

- **CRITICAL RULE**: NEVER use images from the PDF. ONLY request external images from free sources (Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, Unsplash, YouTube).

- **CRITICAL**: Always include Subject + Topic + Specific Details in your search queries

  - Subject: The academic subject (e.g., Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics) - discover this from the PDF content

  - Topic: The main topic from the PDF/note (e.g., Set Theory, Photosynthesis, Organic Reactions)

  - Specific Details: The exact concept (e.g., intersection, union, light-dependent reactions, substitution reaction)

  

- **For EXPLANATIONS**: You can request both images and video tutorials

  - Images: Use `[IMAGE: Subject Topic SpecificDetails]` format

  - Videos: Use `[VIDEO: Subject Topic SpecificDetails]` or `[YT: Subject Topic SpecificDetails]` format

  - **Video Embedding**: When you use `[VIDEO: ...]` or `[YT: ...]` markers, the system will automatically embed the YouTube video in an iframe. The video will be embedded with proper responsive styling and will be playable directly in the document.

  - Place the marker where you want the image/video to appear in your text

  

- **Examples of CORRECT queries**:

  - ✅ `[IMAGE: Mathematics Set Theory Venn diagram intersection]` - for intersection concept

  - ✅ `[IMAGE: Mathematics Set Theory Venn diagram union]` - for union concept (DIFFERENT from intersection)

  - ✅ `[IMAGE: Biology Photosynthesis light-dependent reactions diagram]` - for specific reaction type

  - ✅ `[IMAGE: Biology Photosynthesis Calvin cycle diagram]` - for different reaction type

  - ✅ `[VIDEO: Mathematics Set Theory Venn diagram operations tutorial]` - for video tutorial

  - ✅ `[VIDEO: Biology Cell Division mitosis process tutorial]` - for specific process

  - ✅ `[VIDEO: Chemistry Organic Reactions substitution mechanism explanation]` - for detailed explanation

  

- **Examples of WRONG queries**:

  - ❌ `[IMAGE: venn diagram]` - too vague, doesn't specify subject, topic, or specific concept

  - ❌ `[IMAGE: diagram]` - not specific enough

  - ❌ `[IMAGE: photosynthesis]` - missing specific details (which part of photosynthesis?)

  - ❌ Using the same query for different concepts (e.g., using "venn diagram" for both intersection AND union)

  

- **STRATEGIC MEDIA USAGE**: 

  - **Use images and videos when they add value** - Only include media that directly supports understanding of the content. Media should clarify, illustrate, or enhance concepts that benefit from visual or video representation

  - **When to use images**:

    - Complex processes or workflows that are easier to understand visually

    - Diagrams, charts, or structures that are central to the topic

    - Mathematical concepts that benefit from visual representation (graphs, geometric shapes)

    - Scientific structures (molecular structures, anatomical diagrams, etc.)

    - Concepts that are inherently visual (maps, timelines, classification trees)

  - **When to use videos**:

    - Complex processes that benefit from step-by-step video demonstration

    - Concepts that are better explained through animated or moving visuals

    - Tutorial-style explanations that walk through procedures

    - Visual demonstrations of abstract concepts

    - Problem-solving walkthroughs

  - **When NOT to use media**:

    - Simple text-based concepts that don't need visual aid

    - Abstract ideas that can't be meaningfully visualized

    - Redundant media that doesn't add new information

    - Media that doesn't directly relate to the content being discussed

  - **Place media strategically** - Add images and videos where they enhance understanding, not just for decoration:

    - After introducing a complex concept that benefits from visualization

    - When explaining processes that are clearer with diagrams or video demonstrations

    - For formulas or equations that have meaningful visual representations

    - For structures or classifications that are better understood visually

    - Use videos for complex multi-step processes that benefit from animated explanations

  - **Quality over quantity** - Use 2-4 well-chosen, relevant images and 1-2 videos per major section rather than adding media unnecessarily. Each piece of media should serve a clear educational purpose

  

- **CRITICAL RULES**:

  - ✅ ALWAYS include: Subject (discovered from PDF) + Topic from PDF + Specific Details in every query

  - ✅ Use DIFFERENT queries for DIFFERENT concepts (e.g., "intersection" vs "union" need different images)

  - ✅ DO use: `[IMAGE: Subject Topic SpecificDetails]` format for images

  - ✅ DO use: `[VIDEO: Subject Topic SpecificDetails]` or `[YT: Subject Topic SpecificDetails]` for video tutorials (these will be automatically embedded as iframes)

  - ❌ NEVER use: Base64 encoded images (`data:image/png;base64,...`) - these are not useful

  - ❌ NEVER use: Direct image URLs (`https://example.com/image.png`)

  - ❌ NEVER use: Direct video URLs (`https://youtube.com/watch?v=...`) - use the `[VIDEO: ...]` or `[YT: ...]` format instead, which will be automatically converted to iframe embeds

  - ❌ NEVER use: Generic queries like `[IMAGE: venn diagram]` - always include subject, topic, and specific details

  - ❌ NEVER use: Images from the PDF itself - ONLY request external images from free sources

  - ❌ NEVER use: PDF images, PDF diagrams, or any visual content from the uploaded PDF

  - ❌ NEVER use: The same query for different concepts - each concept needs its own specific query

  

- **PDF Links**: You can include PDF links as hyperlinks in your content. PDF links will be rendered as clickable links that open in a new tab. You can also embed PDFs using iframe format: `<iframe src="https://example.com/document.pdf"></iframe>`. The system will automatically render PDFs in an embedded viewer with an option to open in a new tab.

- **IMPORTANT**: All images must come from external sources only. The system automatically replaces these markers with actual images from Wikipedia/Wikimedia Commons/Unsplash. For videos, the system automatically converts `[VIDEO: ...]` and `[YT: ...]` markers into YouTube iframe embeds. Do NOT extract or reference images from the PDF.

- Use specific, descriptive search queries that include subject, topic, and exact concept details

- Different concepts MUST use different queries to get the correct images/videos

- Place media markers where they will genuinely enhance understanding - only when the media adds educational value

- Use media strategically (2-4 images and 1-2 videos per major section) for concepts that benefit from visual/video representation - avoid unnecessary or redundant media

**Visual Structure** (Optimized for Adaptive Display):

- Create clear visual hierarchy with consistent heading levels

- Use spacing strategically to create visual breaks (especially important for ADHD users)

- Structure content in digestible chunks (2-3 sentence paragraphs work best)

- Use lists liberally to break up dense text

- Include clear transitions between topics
